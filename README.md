### Me

I'm a software engeneer focused on internet related projects, I've been involved
in large backend and frontend projects.

I'm on the side of those who believe that developing software is all about problem
solving. Problems are a very complicated thing to solve, they have constraints,
context, owners and many specific characteristics. So at some point I stoped
thinking about code and start thinking about the problem I'm solving, understand
it, separate it and designing solutions to each part of it.

I love to work around a team as passionate as I am about technology, I like to share
ideas, help, learn and teach.

#### Relevant Projects

##### http://mideastunes.com/
We were presented with a problem that involved a complex front-end architecture,
so we decided on BackBone as our main front-end engine.
We used HTML5 features like push-state, web-audio, ajax bound data-storage.
The backend was written on Sinatra by the backend team, which with we interacted
a lot.

##### http://www.crowdvoice.org/
I came into this project to develop new features, maintain and refactor existing
code. I developed a new css system to bug fix many of the previous issues, refactored
the views system to remove repetition and improve performance. The new features
I worked on this project involved designing and develop an interactive social media
post wall using a component based JS approach. The wall works fully responsive and
is capable to adapt to many displays. The other main feature involved live chart
creation based on stored data as a feature for an infographic creation tool.
The charts rendered on old browsers and had to perform well on mobile.

##### http://breezi.com/
This was the project involved heavy backend development on node and RoR,
I implemented several features for data management, database migration tools,
performance analysis tools, image and file handling. This project in particular
involved a massive refactor, we rewrote the entire application from RoR to a custom
in-house framework, that spawned several general porpouse libraries and tools that
we used later on other projects. We developed and established a formal development
process in order to control the massive amount of code commited everyday.

##### http://recordit.co/
I was involved in the Windows app development, my tasks were related to backend
communication and data sending. I designed and developed a socket based system
for C# based on the Mac app one. Translating architectures was a very cool problem
to solve, dealing with threading and resource access, presented a very challenging
solution. I developed also the deploy strategy using automatic updates and automated
production release process.
